// Description: This program is designed to simulate the working system of a 4-way stoplight: North, South, East, and West. This
//              utilizes the system library of System.Diagnostics to make use of a stopwatch, which allows the program to automatically
//              run without human intervention. This program is a Windows Forms application with a GUI that shows the stoplights and correspondent
//              color changes when the stoplights change. The GUI aslo contains a button that is handled by a method that triggers the whole system and
//              calls other helper methods to carry the system out. Another objective of the project is to analyze the number of cars coming to the intersection
//              from all the directions.
